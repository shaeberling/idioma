## TODOs:
 - Update data based on result. Make the items change bins.
 - Implement quick mode, without text input (left/right for correct/false). Space for next.
 - Allow spreadsheet ID to be entered on ingestion page
 - Make spreadsheet format open once it is stable.
 - Ensure alternative translations are valid, if one original string maps to multiple translations.
   - Show the alternative when user entered one of the correct ones before switching to a new word
 - Show in the UI if an item is a "reverse" item.
